# Useful Cyber tools

A little multi-tool that lets you do simple tasks in cyber security as hashing a password, send an auth mail to someone, generate a random password, and check proxies.

## This is a personal project in Python so be cool, it will grow up :)

There's 5 options for the moment : 
1. Generate a random password
2. Hash a password (SHA256)
3. Authentification code (Beta version)
4. Check my IP (useful for next options)
5. Simple HTTP/S proxy checker
